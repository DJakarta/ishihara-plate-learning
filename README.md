# Ishihara plate learning
Ishihara color deficiency test plates learning tool.  

Good for color blind people that need to pass the test. Memorize the plates from features such as dots, general color, digits seen, paths seen, patterns and whatever else you find useful. Learn the plates by trying and saying what they show again and again.  

Features include random display of plates, normalized plate size, randomized rotation, peek for when you are not sure, percentage of guesses.

## Usage
Input the number on the plate and press the button. For plates with a path, input the number of paths. For plate with no distinct pattern (number or path), input "nimic", meaning "nothing".  
For now, only Romanian version available. Using the app is very simple, though, and there is no need to speak Romanian in order to do so.
Only the standard set of 38 Ishihara plates is available.

## Motivation
Color deficient people often find themselves in situations which require taking a standard test for them to be allowed to perform an activity (driving, for example), for which there may be need to ban every color deficient person. A lot of government regulation requires people taking the Ishihara 38 plate test. The problem is that in reality it is not always necessary for someone to have normal color vision for that activity.  
A good portion of the population (5 to 10 percent) suffers from forms of color perception problems. There are a lot of types of color deficiencies (http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/types-of-colour-blindness/), and the most common do not impede people in doing casual activities in safety. The Ishihara tests, unfortunately, do not have sufficient precision to tell which kind of color deficiency you have, so mildly color deficient people (the great majority of color perception problems) may be left out of these activities for no reason. Fighting with governments and regulation is hard, however, when even top health executives, doctors and experts lack a basing understanding of phyisical and medical principles behind color perception. I have, therefore, developed this learning tool to help other color deficient people (but mostly myself) learn the standard set of plates which most clinics use in order to pass the test.  
_Some activities definitely allow for people to be practicing them with no impedance with some forms of color deficiencty. If you are going to bypass regulations, you are responsible for judging whether the activity you are planning on doing is compatible or no with your condition. There are some activities that do require a very good color perception of different hues and conditions that are incopmatible with some activities. You should consider carefully when taking the decision to learn the plates and fake normal vision, and I highly recommend going to a good doctor for a proper diagnostic and learning about your condition.
