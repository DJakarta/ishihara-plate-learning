# Ishihara plate learning
Ishihara color blindness test plates learning tool.  

Good for color blind people that need to pass the test. Memorize the plates from features such as dots, general color, digits seen, paths seen, patterns and whatever else you find useful. Learn the plates by trying and saying what they show again and again.  

Features include random display of plates, normalized plate size, randomized rotation, peek for when you are not sure, percentage of guesses.

## Usage
Input the number on the plate and press the button. For plates with a path, input the number of paths. For plate with no distinct pattern (number or path), input "nimic", meaning "nothing".  
For now, only Romanian version available. Using the app is very simple, though, and there is no need to speak Romanian in order to do so.
